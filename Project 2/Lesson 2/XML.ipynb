      "Background\n",
      "Dynamic US examination is a convenient, accurate, inexpensive and reproducible diagnostic tool for assessing the integrity of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis in ankle injuries. However normal values for physiological functional widening of the anterior tibiofibular clear space in healthy subjects has yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to determine normal values for the syndesmosis clear space on ultrasound examination.\n",

      "\n",
      "                  \n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We evaluated 110 healthy subjects. A dynamic U.S examination was performed in neutral (N), forced internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) of the ankle. In each position the anterior tibiofibular clear space was measured at the level of the anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament (AITFL). Height and calf length were also recorded. Results were analyzed in relation to age, activity, dominant leg and gender.\n",

      "Results\n",
      "Mean age was 32 years (range 16–60). There were 59 males and 51 females. 60% were professional athletes. Mean height was 173 cm (range 149–192). Functional Mean position measurements for clear space opening were: N=3.7mm, IR=3.6mm and ER=4.0mm. In younger men and women the clear space was significantly wider in neutral (Men: Y=3.8, O=3.4 \\ Women: Y=3.8, O=3.4) and with rotational force application (Men ER: Y=4.1, O=3.6 \\ Women ER: Y=4.1, O=3.8) compared to older subjects (p<0.05). There was no correlation with activity, height or the leg length.\n",
      "Females had a higher syndesmosis widening ratio (ER/N) under stress than males (p<0.01) this tended to occur more commonly in active subjects.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "Normal values for the syndesmosis clear space on ultrasound examination were determined as 3.78mm in neutral, 3.64mm in internal rotation and 4.08mm in external rotation. The clear space was shown to decrease with age both as an absolute measure and when rotational stresses are applied. Females tend to have a larger clear space and a greater functional widening.\n",
      "These findings provide a useful reference for radiologists and sports physicians when performing ultrasound assessment of ankle syndesmotic injuries and we encourage use of this modality.\n",

      "We evaluated 110 healthy subjects all of whom gave informed consent for the study. : “Meir” University Hospital, Kfar-Saba, Israel ethics approval was obtained prior to recruitment. Ultrasound examination of both ankles was performed in all subjects by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist (XX) and reviewed by a sports physician, using a 7.5-12 MHz linear transducer HDI 5000 SonoCT ATL (Philips, Andover, Massachusetts). Ultrasound images were obtained to visualize the syndesmosis landmarks, recorded and printed. The printed images were re-evaluated by the primary investigators. If a previous injury was reported or suspected due to a thickened, torn, scarred or deficient AITFL, the subject’s relevant ankle was excluded from the study.\n",

      "In this study we have established that the normal tibio-fibular clear space is 3.78mm and that the mean widening of the tibio-fibular clear space is 0.3mm for ER-N and 0.44mm for ER-IR on dynamic ultrasound examination. In neutral position a measurement of 5.06 mm (Std. Dev. 0.64, 3.78+2SD=5.06) would be 2 standard deviations above the mean. This suggests a measurement greater than this should be suspected as abnormal. Females had increased clear space opening with forced external rotation, with a significantly greater “widening ratio” of the AITFL to applied stress. This agrees with the literature as female subjects tend to be more flexible than males \n",

We believe this is the first study to record syndesmotic opening dynamically in normal subjects.\n",
      "One of the features of this presented method is reproducibility.

      "Another potential weakness is the lack of a standardized deforming force to recreate the opening of the syndesmosis. As this was a clinical study on live subjects the syndesmosis was not tested to failure but merely the width at maximal opening was determined. External rotation was performed until a firm recognizable end point was reached. Error was minimized by the same examiner applying a similar rotational force, and appreciating the same firm end point from neutral dorsiflexion/plantarflexion in each case.\n",
      "Age groups compared in this study were under and over 40 years of age. We have chosen 40years as a cutoff age between young and older group as most of our study subjects fell into these two main groups. We had one cluster around 20–30 years of age, which usually stand for the population who tend to suffer from syndesmosis injuries, and another cluster around the 50 years of age. We had very few subjects between 35 to 45 years of age, and no one at that exact age.\n",

      "Normal values for the syndesmosis clear space on ultrasound examination were determined as 3.78 mm in neutral, 3.64 mm in internal rotation and 4.08mm in external rotation. The clear space was shown to decrease with age both as an absolute measure and when rotational stresses are applied. Females tend to have a larger clear space and a greater functional widening.\n",
      "These findings provide a useful reference for radiologists and sports physicians when performing ultrasound assessment of ankle syndesmotic injuries as well as a measurable tool for diagnosis of this often missed injury and we encourage use of this modality.\n",
